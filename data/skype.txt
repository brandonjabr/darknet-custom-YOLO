[4/10/17, 5:58:54 PM] brandon.jabr: also one thing is
[4/10/17, 5:59:10 PM] brandon.jabr: the resolution is that he must return it and prove shipping before i have to refund him
[4/10/17, 5:59:19 PM] brandon.jabr: which actually is fine because i gave him way too good of a deal
[4/10/17, 5:59:33 PM] Matt B.: haha damn what a dick

[4/15/17, 10:59:37 AM] brandon.jabr: yoo
[4/15/17, 10:59:50 AM] brandon.jabr: yea so actually it looks like its worked out in my favor,
[4/15/17, 11:00:29 AM] brandon.jabr: so basically i sold the dude a hella rare set of headphones i can sell for $500, and at the time i sold em to him for $400 cause i wasn't getting offers
[4/15/17, 11:00:57 AM] brandon.jabr: so PayPal decided that he has until april 20th to ship them to me and prove he did so
[4/15/17, 11:01:54 AM] brandon.jabr: so far its been 2 weeks and he hasn't, so in the case he just gave up ill just get my $400 back which is dope, if he does decide to ship em back, they dont give me the 400 back but i can just resell em for more so
[4/15/17, 11:02:19 AM] brandon.jabr: in the end it seems like a win win for me,
[4/15/17, 11:02:19 AM] Matt B.: haha nice works out
[4/15/17, 11:02:27 AM] brandon.jabr: haha yeeee
[4/15/17, 11:02:28 AM] Matt B.: what if he sends em back and u keep the $400
[4/15/17, 11:02:31 AM] Matt B.: lool
[4/15/17, 11:02:43 AM] brandon.jabr: yea so they took it way long ago
[4/15/17, 11:02:56 AM] brandon.jabr: which is why i asked you originally cause thats some bullshit that
[4/15/17, 11:03:06 AM] brandon.jabr: as soon as someone files a claim they hold the funds
[4/15/17, 11:03:13 AM] Matt B.: haha yeah pp is quick like that
[4/15/17, 11:03:24 AM] Matt B.: they want to control it, but they dont know how

[4/15/17, 11:05:40 AM] Matt B.: so a few weeks ago i was doing maddd research on bitcoin trading
[4/15/17, 11:05:43 AM] Matt B.: for that ML script
[4/15/17, 11:05:52 AM] Matt B.: and i stumbled upon this stanford case study
[4/15/17, 11:05:54 AM] Matt B.: http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2014/Isaac%20Madan,%20Shaurya%20Saluja,%20Aojia%20Zhao,Automated%20Bitcoin%20Trading%20via%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms.pdf
[4/15/17, 11:06:15 AM] Matt B.: p neat actually
[4/15/17, 11:06:31 AM] brandon.jabr: what the fuck
[4/15/17, 11:06:37 AM] Matt B.: if for some reason we do this ML script
[4/15/17, 11:06:42 AM] Matt B.: this case study got  it al
[4/15/17, 11:06:43 AM] brandon.jabr: 98.7% accuracy on trend using random forests...
[4/15/17, 11:07:11 AM] brandon.jabr: i just made a random forest model for my last hw
[4/15/17, 11:07:20 AM] Matt B.: haha idk what that is
[4/15/17, 11:07:26 AM] Matt B.: but the more i do research on auto btc trading
[4/15/17, 11:07:30 AM] Matt B.: the more i think we should do it
[4/15/17, 11:07:52 AM] brandon.jabr: ok this paper was a hella fuckin good find
[4/15/17, 11:07:58 AM] Matt B.: hahaha right
[4/15/17, 11:08:02 AM] brandon.jabr: this is reading to me like
[4/15/17, 11:08:13 AM] brandon.jabr: i know how to do all this put simply haha
[4/15/17, 11:08:16 AM] brandon.jabr: but
[4/15/17, 11:08:39 AM] brandon.jabr: they say what features they used to train it but the key thing wed need is the data
[4/15/17, 11:08:47 AM] Matt B.: yeah true
[4/15/17, 11:08:54 AM] Matt B.: they only reason im so skeptical is
[4/15/17, 11:09:06 AM] Matt B.: a lot of research ive done says nobody ever trusts services like these
[4/15/17, 11:09:16 AM] Matt B.: so idk if it'll be a bust
[4/15/17, 11:09:19 AM] Matt B.: or a gold mine
[4/15/17, 11:09:26 AM] brandon.jabr: i mean tbh like
[4/15/17, 11:09:35 AM] brandon.jabr: there obviously exist many such services
[4/15/17, 11:09:53 AM] brandon.jabr: and some might be total bs and a few might be actually good AI wise
[4/15/17, 11:10:15 AM] brandon.jabr: but question is
[4/15/17, 11:10:42 AM] brandon.jabr: is there one that both uses really proper AI and has a great UI etc
[4/15/17, 11:10:57 AM] Matt B.: nope not at all
[4/15/17, 11:11:04 AM] Matt B.: there are like4 main competitors we'd have
[4/15/17, 11:11:08 AM] Matt B.: and they all look like shit
[4/15/17, 11:11:13 AM] Matt B.: would b easy to blow em out
[4/15/17, 11:11:45 AM] brandon.jabr: aight well you'd know that so then id say its has potential forsure
[4/15/17, 11:11:52 AM] brandon.jabr: also like
[4/15/17, 11:11:58 AM] Matt B.: Bots that are available on the market include Haasbot, Tradewave and Cryptotrader, the latter of which is cloud-based.
[4/15/17, 11:12:03 AM] Matt B.: yeah those 3 are the big 1's
[4/15/17, 11:12:13 AM] Matt B.: haasbot is the biggest
[4/15/17, 11:12:22 AM] Matt B.: and there site is ass
[4/15/17, 11:12:22 AM] brandon.jabr: fasho we should research those hella first
[4/15/17, 11:12:34 AM] brandon.jabr: the way i see it
[4/15/17, 11:13:06 AM] brandon.jabr: in general apps that basically manage your money using AI are huge right now, even if they don't make shit
[4/15/17, 11:13:15 AM] brandon.jabr: case in point is acorns, the most dumbass investing app ever
[4/15/17, 11:13:21 AM] Matt B.: lmao true
[4/15/17, 11:13:33 AM] brandon.jabr: and wealth front and betterment
[4/15/17, 11:13:42 AM] brandon.jabr: so i mean the model is completely proven
[4/15/17, 11:13:48 AM] Matt B.: i see
[4/15/17, 11:13:54 AM] Matt B.: the way i see it is 2 diff ways
[4/15/17, 11:14:11 AM] Matt B.: 1 we keep this shit between us 4 and just run the bots 24/7 for us
[4/15/17, 11:14:22 AM] Matt B.: cuz if we have a script that turn water into wine
[4/15/17, 11:14:27 AM] Matt B.: why would we sell it imo
[4/15/17, 11:14:42 AM] Matt B.: but the other way i see it is if we do ssell it
[4/15/17, 11:14:48 AM] brandon.jabr: yea i mean
[4/15/17, 11:14:49 AM] Matt B.: it'll be either a bust or a gold mine
[4/15/17, 11:14:56 AM] Matt B.: no inbetween imo
[4/15/17, 11:14:56 AM] Matt B.: lol
[4/15/17, 11:15:01 AM] brandon.jabr: yea thats def true haha
[4/15/17, 11:15:10 AM] brandon.jabr: i agree with that plan A plan B
[4/15/17, 11:15:23 AM] brandon.jabr: but that being said honestly
[4/15/17, 11:16:08 AM] brandon.jabr: surely theres been hundreds of attempts by good Machine learning engineers to try and predict btc
[4/15/17, 11:16:40 AM] brandon.jabr: if that existed it couldn't be kept a secret for long cause it'd ruin btc
[4/15/17, 11:16:53 AM] Matt B.: hmm that is a good point
[4/15/17, 11:18:20 AM] brandon.jabr: basically what i mean is, i doubt any machine learning will like make bank automatically, but if it produces the results in that paper which i can follow step by step and reproduce, and it'll say with 99% accuracy whether or not its trending up or down by the next day
[4/15/17, 11:18:24 AM] brandon.jabr: people will pay for that
[4/15/17, 11:18:43 AM] brandon.jabr: but isn't that what blockchain.info does/
[4/15/17, 11:18:44 AM] Matt B.: lol i'd pay for that
[4/15/17, 11:18:48 AM] brandon.jabr: well actually
[4/15/17, 11:18:56 AM] brandon.jabr: but then were taking it another step by saing
[4/15/17, 11:20:07 AM] brandon.jabr: our service gives you a btc wallet that acts like an investment acc, put in what your willing to invest with risk, we take a small %, and you might end up making a lot
[4/15/17, 11:20:36 AM] brandon.jabr: i mean thats what all investment is haha, i think people will try it even if just for the fun of it
[4/15/17, 11:20:55 AM] Matt B.: yeah i think thats the route we should take if we do decide to do this
[4/15/17, 11:21:22 AM] brandon.jabr: yee
[4/15/17, 11:21:22 AM] Matt B.: idk im still down to do the idea
[4/15/17, 11:21:33 AM] Matt B.: but i feel like we should keep brainstorming

[4/15/17, 12:02:30 PM] Matt B.: im confused
[4/15/17, 12:02:39 PM] brandon.jabr: yea just a desktop with
[4/15/17, 12:02:46 PM] brandon.jabr: all components optimized for machine learning
[4/15/17, 12:02:50 PM] Matt B.: oh is it kinda like
[4/15/17, 12:02:52 PM] brandon.jabr: which is all about GPU

[4/15/17, 12:02:56 PM] Matt B.: ?
[4/15/17, 12:03:06 PM] brandon.jabr: yea but instead id install a linux distro
[4/15/17, 12:03:10 PM] Matt B.: oh fasho
[4/15/17, 12:03:16 PM] brandon.jabr: PC just meaning desktop in general

[4/15/17, 12:12:40 PM] Matt B.: ?
[4/15/17, 12:12:53 PM] Matt B.: or the best 1
[4/15/17, 12:13:00 PM] brandon.jabr: csvwriter for writing to a set, for reading in a set forsure pandas
[4/15/17, 12:13:04 PM] brandon.jabr: what u tryna do?
[4/15/17, 12:13:06 PM] Matt B.: i see like 10
[4/15/17, 12:13:11 PM] Matt B.: literally just read an excel file
[4/15/17, 12:13:16 PM] brandon.jabr: go with pandas
[4/15/17, 12:13:26 PM] Matt B.: fasho
[4/15/17, 12:13:38 PM] brandon.jabr: its all purpose data visualization but you just do like
[4/15/17, 12:13:45 PM] brandon.jabr: pandas.read(
[4/15/17, 12:13:54 PM] brandon.jabr: pandas.read('file.csv')
[4/15/17, 12:14:14 PM] brandon.jabr: and if u print that variable it makes a nice table etc
[4/15/17, 12:15:18 PM] Matt B.: littt
[4/15/17, 12:17:04 PM] Matt B.: yo idk if u ever use the database for your scripts
[4/15/17, 12:17:12 PM] Matt B.: but u should check out peewee python lib
[4/15/17, 12:17:15 PM] Matt B.: shits badass af
[4/15/17, 12:17:56 PM] brandon.jabr: i haven't but i really should
[4/15/17, 12:18:04 PM] brandon.jabr: oh this is lit
[4/15/17, 12:18:08 PM] Matt B.: its a lightweight ORM
[4/15/17, 12:18:26 PM] brandon.jabr: just like
[4/15/17, 12:18:30 PM] brandon.jabr: obj relational model?
[4/15/17, 12:18:32 PM] brandon.jabr: im guessing
[4/15/17, 12:18:37 PM] Matt B.: yaaa
[4/15/17, 12:18:42 PM] brandon.jabr: yee
[4/15/17, 12:18:46 PM] Matt B.: shits boss

[4/15/17, 12:18:59 PM] brandon.jabr: is just like the go to basic sql db?
[4/15/17, 12:19:10 PM] Matt B.: naw i use postgresql
[4/15/17, 12:19:16 PM] Matt B.: and peewee ORM
[4/15/17, 12:19:25 PM] brandon.jabr: ah fasho
[4/15/17, 12:19:29 PM] Matt B.: so like my models.py is this
[4/15/17, 12:19:29 PM] Matt B.: class Account(BaseModel):
    name = peewee.CharField(max_length=100)
    type = peewee.CharField(max_length=20)
    balance = peewee.IntegerField()
    pin = peewee.IntegerField()
    created = peewee.DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    last_updated = peewee.DateTimeField()

db.connect()
db.create_table(Account, safe=True)
db.close()
[4/15/17, 12:19:35 PM] Matt B.: makes an account table in my postgresql db
[4/15/17, 12:19:54 PM] Matt B.: and all i needa do to get info from the DB is this shit
[4/15/17, 12:19:55 PM] Matt B.: acc = Account.get(name=name)
[4/15/17, 12:19:58 PM] brandon.jabr: damn so clean
[4/15/17, 12:20:09 PM] Matt B.: yeah orm is so boss
[4/15/17, 12:20:23 PM] Matt B.: imagine me writing SELECT * FROM account WHERE user=user
[4/15/17, 12:20:24 PM] Matt B.: lmao smh
[4/15/17, 12:20:29 PM] Matt B.: sql language is shat to my ass
[4/15/17, 12:20:38 PM] brandon.jabr: yea haha
[4/15/17, 12:20:47 PM] brandon.jabr: i straight up refuse to use that at this point
[4/15/17, 12:20:51 PM] brandon.jabr: i just want to know
[4/15/17, 12:20:53 PM] Matt B.: yeah idk how i ever did tbh
[4/15/17, 12:20:56 PM] brandon.jabr: like
[4/15/17, 12:21:15 PM] brandon.jabr: like i was asking u before and tbh I haven't fully decided
[4/15/17, 12:21:26 PM] brandon.jabr: if I'm a non web dev with scripts in python for like ml or whatever
[4/15/17, 12:21:43 PM] brandon.jabr: what is the fastest way for me to just make that runnable on a website with minimal UI
[4/15/17, 12:21:49 PM] Matt B.: oh use flask
[4/15/17, 12:21:57 PM] brandon.jabr: yea ok
[4/15/17, 12:21:59 PM] Matt B.: flask is lightweight web framework
[4/15/17, 12:22:00 PM] Matt B.: BUT
[4/15/17, 12:22:05 PM] Matt B.: if u wanna do like real-time data
[4/15/17, 12:22:13 PM] Matt B.: which idk u may use
[4/15/17, 12:22:27 PM] Matt B.: use tornado
[4/15/17, 12:22:32 PM] brandon.jabr: ok yea
[4/15/17, 12:22:48 PM] Matt B.: tornado is actually so boss
[4/15/17, 12:22:54 PM] Matt B.: i cannot wait to learn it
[4/15/17, 12:23:19 PM] Matt B.: tornado is a web framework that uses asynchronous
[4/15/17, 12:23:21 PM] Matt B.: like
[4/15/17, 12:23:23 PM] Matt B.: IO loops
[4/15/17, 12:23:33 PM] Matt B.: shit is just like nodejs in the way it handles requests
[4/15/17, 12:23:55 PM] Matt B.: idk i assume u want real time data shown on a ml script ya
[4/15/17, 12:23:56 PM] Matt B.: ?
[4/15/17, 12:24:04 PM] brandon.jabr: yea actually definitely
[4/15/17, 12:24:11 PM] Matt B.: yeah def use tornado
[4/15/17, 12:24:47 PM] Matt B.: i think imma use tornado and asyncio in python more than django and flask
[4/15/17, 12:25:43 PM] brandon.jabr: yea both django and node weren't what i wanted
[4/15/17, 12:25:56 PM] Matt B.: o
[4/15/17, 12:26:21 PM] Matt B.: why not node?
[4/15/17, 12:26:31 PM] Matt B.: does it need to be python framework?
[4/15/17, 12:27:01 PM] brandon.jabr: i ran into so many errors for this and that little reason when just trying to do the official node.js tutorial app on their site
[4/15/17, 12:27:37 PM] Matt B.: oh i see
[4/15/17, 12:27:42 PM] brandon.jabr: which isn't nodes fault really but its too heavy and i didn't find that it was all that fast
[4/15/17, 12:27:47 PM] brandon.jabr: like
[4/15/17, 12:27:54 PM] brandon.jabr: meteor is a great example
[4/15/17, 12:28:07 PM] brandon.jabr: of like 0 to 100 asap
[4/15/17, 12:28:35 PM] brandon.jabr: but its not as mature as flask etc so yea i should try flask and see
[4/15/17, 12:28:54 PM] Matt B.: yeah flask would be your best bet
[4/15/17, 12:34:53 PM] Matt B.: aight im off
[4/15/17, 12:34:53 PM] Matt B.: peace
[4/15/17, 12:43:51 PM] brandon.jabr: peacee

[4/16/17, 10:50:38 AM] brandon.jabr: but was going ham last night
[4/16/17, 10:51:00 AM] brandon.jabr: tryna figure out what the absolute best machine learning + web combo and frameworks are
[4/16/17, 10:51:57 AM] brandon.jabr: and for my ml part its forsure tensor flow which i know, and like
[4/16/17, 10:52:22 AM] brandon.jabr: either microsoft azures new cognition model
[4/16/17, 10:52:25 AM] brandon.jabr: or AWS
[4/16/17, 10:53:03 AM] brandon.jabr: but thats for like when its optimized / big, for now tryna do what u said and learn flask / tornado
[4/16/17, 10:53:07 AM] Matt B.: huh did u find any combo that worked
[4/16/17, 10:53:15 AM] Matt B.: oh i see
[4/16/17, 10:53:22 AM] brandon.jabr: oh yea tons
[4/16/17, 10:53:22 AM] Matt B.: yeah i think flask is your best bet
[4/16/17, 10:53:26 AM] Matt B.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38935428/tensorflow-rest-frontend-but-not-tensorflow-serving
[4/16/17, 10:53:30 AM] Matt B.: idk if thats what u lookin for

[4/16/17, 10:53:44 AM] Matt B.: lol
[4/16/17, 10:54:06 AM] Matt B.: omg i cant wait to learn tornado
[4/16/17, 10:55:20 AM] Matt B.: yo you ever heard of the asyncio library in python3
[4/16/17, 10:55:21 AM] Matt B.: ?
[4/16/17, 10:55:49 AM] brandon.jabr: yea for like live time socket IO
[4/16/17, 10:55:57 AM] Matt B.: yeah holy shit
[4/16/17, 10:56:01 AM] brandon.jabr: friend was showing me it for a game hes making
[4/16/17, 10:56:07 AM] Matt B.: its actually so boss
[4/16/17, 10:56:24 AM] Matt B.: like idk why every decently big program doesnt use asyncio
[4/16/17, 10:56:45 AM] brandon.jabr: i know tornado is hella popular
[4/16/17, 10:56:49 AM] brandon.jabr: isn't that like a wrapper for async
[4/16/17, 10:56:52 AM] Matt B.: yeah
[4/16/17, 10:56:58 AM] Matt B.: tornado is basically the nodejs of python
[4/16/17, 10:57:11 AM] Matt B.: which is boss
[4/16/17, 10:57:20 AM] Matt B.: cuz i like py code but want that socket io feature
[4/16/17, 10:57:34 AM] Matt B.: for real time data
[4/16/17, 10:58:05 AM] brandon.jabr: yea that is hella nice actuallh
[4/16/17, 10:58:12 AM] brandon.jabr: hat u gonna use that for
[4/16/17, 10:58:48 AM] Matt B.: web dev
[4/16/17, 10:59:07 AM] Matt B.: making asynchronous sites
[4/16/17, 10:59:18 AM] Matt B.: real time live sites in python

[4/16/17, 11:11:41 AM] brandon.jabr: oh yea so
[4/16/17, 11:11:50 AM] brandon.jabr: you get a package manager called conda
[4/16/17, 11:11:56 AM] brandon.jabr: and to switch to python2 lets say
[4/16/17, 11:12:08 AM] brandon.jabr: you just make an environment thats saved permanently
[4/16/17, 11:12:10 AM] brandon.jabr: like
[4/16/17, 11:12:27 AM] brandon.jabr: condo create -n py2env python=2.7 anaconda
[4/16/17, 11:12:32 AM] Matt B.: oh fasho
[4/16/17, 11:12:35 AM] brandon.jabr: boom now u can just go
[4/16/17, 11:12:37 AM] Matt B.: yeee
[4/16/17, 11:12:39 AM] brandon.jabr: source activate py2env
[4/16/17, 11:12:40 AM] brandon.jabr: yee
[4/16/17, 11:12:47 AM] Matt B.: ok im done installing anaconda 3
[4/16/17, 11:12:49 AM] Matt B.: what now
[4/16/17, 11:12:51 AM] brandon.jabr: alriiiiighg
[4/16/17, 11:12:55 AM] brandon.jabr: so close and open ur term
[4/16/17, 11:12:57 AM] brandon.jabr: then
[4/16/17, 11:13:00 AM] brandon.jabr: just type
[4/16/17, 11:13:17 AM] brandon.jabr: jupyter notebook
[4/16/17, 11:13:29 AM] Matt B.: haha yoo
[4/16/17, 11:13:30 AM] brandon.jabr: should open a web browser at ur home directory,
[4/16/17, 11:13:32 AM] Matt B.: this tight
[4/16/17, 11:13:34 AM] brandon.jabr: omfg
[4/16/17, 11:13:36 AM] brandon.jabr: so ok
[4/16/17, 11:13:37 AM] brandon.jabr: so
[4/16/17, 11:13:41 AM] brandon.jabr: at the top
[4/16/17, 11:13:46 AM] brandon.jabr: say create new
[4/16/17, 11:13:48 AM] brandon.jabr: then python 3
[4/16/17, 11:13:51 AM] brandon.jabr: and witness
[4/16/17, 11:14:02 AM] brandon.jabr: the new way to code python haha
[4/16/17, 11:14:23 AM] Matt B.: do ineed to connect to the kernel
[4/16/17, 11:14:24 AM] Matt B.: ?
[4/16/17, 11:14:30 AM] brandon.jabr: yea
[4/16/17, 11:14:33 AM] Matt B.: whats that mean
[4/16/17, 11:14:34 AM] brandon.jabr: should link to ur
[4/16/17, 11:15:01 AM] brandon.jabr: as in it should point to the python your linux is using which anaconda sets to the one in anaconda
[4/16/17, 11:15:07 AM] brandon.jabr: but thats good cause it needs that
[4/16/17, 11:15:11 AM] brandon.jabr: whats it sayin?
[4/16/17, 11:16:03 AM] Matt B.: sec
[4/16/17, 11:17:17 AM] Matt B.: cant find my damn ass py3 path
[4/16/17, 11:17:29 AM] brandon.jabr: hmm should be like
[4/16/17, 11:17:41 AM] Matt B.: ya i cant find where to edit it
[4/16/17, 11:17:47 AM] Matt B.: on jupyter
[4/16/17, 11:17:47 AM] brandon.jabr: sec
[4/16/17, 11:18:25 AM] brandon.jabr: oh oh
[4/16/17, 11:18:29 AM] brandon.jabr: ok in terminal
[4/16/17, 11:18:31 AM] brandon.jabr: just do
[4/16/17, 11:18:42 AM] brandon.jabr: conda install ipykernel
[4/16/17, 11:18:47 AM] brandon.jabr: then u should be chillin
[4/16/17, 11:19:41 AM] Matt B.: hmm
[4/16/17, 11:19:43 AM] Matt B.: still not workin
[4/16/17, 11:19:45 AM] Matt B.: [W 11:19:34.384 NotebookApp] KernelRestarter: restart failed

[4/16/17, 11:21:25 AM] Matt B.: know
[4/16/17, 11:21:51 AM] brandon.jabr: jupyterrr.mov
[4/16/17, 11:22:13 AM] brandon.jabr: yea condo is picky with all that but when properly set up its worth never having to get anythin
[4/16/17, 11:22:32 AM] brandon.jabr: that vid shows what the notebook looks like haha
[4/16/17, 11:22:38 AM] brandon.jabr: and it running the ml script for example
[4/16/17, 11:22:44 AM] brandon.jabr: matplotlib inline graphics
[4/16/17, 11:23:01 AM] Matt B.: trynna figure out what my pass is
[4/16/17, 11:23:15 AM] Matt B.: i think its breaking cuz im using some shit browser (the default linux one)
[4/16/17, 11:23:25 AM] Matt B.: when i actually use firefox, but its not opening that browser
[4/16/17, 11:24:47 AM] brandon.jabr: oh also
[4/16/17, 11:24:53 AM] brandon.jabr: u using bash or zsh?

[4/16/17, 11:25:08 AM] Matt B.: havent tried zsh yet
[4/16/17, 11:25:09 AM] brandon.jabr: source ~/.bashrc
[4/16/17, 11:25:24 AM] brandon.jabr: ye that shouldn't matter tho
[4/16/17, 11:25:27 AM] brandon.jabr: what like
[4/16/17, 11:25:32 AM] brandon.jabr: error is showing int he browser
[4/16/17, 11:26:00 AM] Matt B.: A connection to the notebook server could not be established. The notebook will continue trying to reconnect. Check your network connection or notebook server configuration.
[4/16/17, 11:26:17 AM] brandon.jabr: is the address like localhost:8888
[4/16/17, 11:26:25 AM] Matt B.: yeah
[4/16/17, 11:26:31 AM] Matt B.: its weird cuz when i go back to my list

[4/16/17, 11:26:44 AM] Matt B.: server
[4/16/17, 11:26:48 AM] brandon.jabr: thats the notebook
[4/16/17, 11:27:00 AM] Matt B.: just cant connect to kernel
[4/16/17, 11:27:00 AM] brandon.jabr: .ipynb is the notebook file extension
[4/16/17, 11:27:03 AM] brandon.jabr: hmm
[4/16/17, 11:27:04 AM] Matt B.: fasho
[4/16/17, 11:27:53 AM] Matt B.: oh snap

[4/16/17, 11:30:57 AM] brandon.jabr: so lik
[4/16/17, 11:31:16 AM] brandon.jabr: its just too wet for python haha
[4/16/17, 11:31:32 AM] brandon.jabr: don't have to run whole file, make as many cells as u want
[4/16/17, 11:31:38 AM] brandon.jabr: all output is inline
[4/16/17, 11:31:49 AM] brandon.jabr: so debugging is piss easy
[4/16/17, 11:31:55 AM] brandon.jabr: even graphing etc is inline
[4/16/17, 11:32:15 AM] Matt B.: haha wtf
[4/16/17, 11:32:19 AM] Matt B.: this is like a matlab for python
[4/16/17, 11:32:22 AM] brandon.jabr: hahah yea
[4/16/17, 11:32:35 AM] brandon.jabr: its universally used at the least for data science
[4/16/17, 11:32:37 AM] brandon.jabr: too wet
[4/16/17, 11:32:44 AM] Matt B.: what else can i do
[4/16/17, 11:32:46 AM] brandon.jabr: SHIFT+ENTER

[4/16/17, 11:38:00 AM] brandon.jabr: theres magic commands
[4/16/17, 11:38:02 AM] brandon.jabr: so ok
[4/16/17, 11:38:08 AM] brandon.jabr: make any function and call it
[4/16/17, 11:38:19 AM] brandon.jabr: or on any line like a = [1,2,3]
[4/16/17, 11:38:26 AM] brandon.jabr: now add %prun before it
[4/16/17, 11:38:31 AM] brandon.jabr: %prun a = [1,2,3]
[4/16/17, 11:38:36 AM] brandon.jabr: those are magic commands
[4/16/17, 11:38:39 AM] brandon.jabr: that time every single
[4/16/17, 11:38:46 AM] brandon.jabr: call made so u know what makes ur shit slow

[4/16/17, 11:45:38 AM] Matt B.: Berkeley DB (BDB) is a software library intended to provide a high-performance embedded database for key/value data. Berkeley DB is written in C with API bindings for C++, C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Tcl, and many other programming languages. BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports multiple data items for a single key. Berkeley DB is not a relational database.[1]
[4/16/17, 11:45:38 AM] brandon.jabr: hmm
[4/16/17, 11:45:59 AM] Matt B.: Berkeley DB originated at the University of California, Berkeley as part of BSD, Berkeley's version of the Unix operating system.

[4/21/17, 10:09:39 AM] brandon.jabr: including jessie
[4/21/17, 10:10:14 AM] brandon.jabr: it seems like my best option for both using my 4k display and compatibility with all my data science / ml stuff
[4/21/17, 10:10:25 AM] brandon.jabr: is kubuntu aka ubuntu with KDE
[4/21/17, 10:10:46 AM] brandon.jabr: but im settin up everything now and its comin out beautifully
[4/21/17, 10:11:11 AM] brandon.jabr: ~~~~
[4/21/17, 10:12:26 AM] brandon.jabr: was really the lack of support for 4k display that threw me way off
[4/21/17, 10:12:51 AM] brandon.jabr: almost none of the linux distros do it perfectly, but KDE on ubuntu is closest
[4/21/17, 10:15:28 AM] Matt B.: ohhh i see
[4/21/17, 10:15:41 AM] Matt B.: i run kubuntu on my linux laptop
[4/21/17, 10:15:47 AM] Matt B.: havent had 1issue on it
[4/21/17, 10:16:10 AM] Matt B.: one thing i had to do was run the ubuntu desktop before installing it
[4/21/17, 10:16:29 AM] Matt B.: like the option where u can try ubuntu out before u instal it
[4/21/17, 10:16:37 AM] Matt B.: and u connect to the wifi, then start installing it
[4/21/17, 10:16:50 AM] Matt B.: haha that was the only hiccup when installin
[4/21/17, 10:17:35 AM] Matt B.: but kubuntu is ballin, its just got debian
[4/21/17, 10:17:55 AM] brandon.jabr: yee overall kubuntu is super solid
[4/21/17, 10:18:02 AM] brandon.jabr: idk why anyone uses the unity default ubuntu
[4/21/17, 10:18:11 AM] Matt B.: lol yeah idk that shit sucks

[4/29/17, 10:41:01 AM] brandon.jabr: but the underlying math is stats that works on vectors/matrices and also needs calculus on vectors/matrices

[4/29/17, 10:45:01 AM] Matt B.: every other year or somethin

[4/29/17, 10:45:31 AM] Matt B.: a lot of companies are past that preliminary bullshit

[4/29/17, 10:45:48 AM] Matt B.: like sonia said at NW they be teachin them javascript
[4/29/17, 10:45:49 AM] Matt B.: thats lit
[4/29/17, 10:45:57 AM] brandon.jabr: ive been thinking a lot actually and i think you totally see things the same way
[4/29/17, 10:46:22 AM] brandon.jabr: that America is literally a company where the beginning and end of everything is simply determined by money
[4/29/17, 10:46:29 AM] brandon.jabr: how much goes in how much comes out
[4/29/17, 10:47:23 AM] brandon.jabr: as in how valuable anything is, a company or a specific job etc is just determined by what investors will put into that field or specific area
[4/29/17, 10:47:58 AM] brandon.jabr: and i feel like that viewpoint makes the world a lot clearer like answers a ton of questions
[4/29/17, 10:48:09 AM] brandon.jabr: you reminded me cause like lets say school in America
[4/29/17, 10:48:13 AM] brandon.jabr: why is it shit
[4/29/17, 10:48:19 AM] brandon.jabr: and other countries do so much better
[4/29/17, 10:48:47 AM] brandon.jabr: simply because, for one, working in education in America is considered a beat job
[4/29/17, 10:48:57 AM] brandon.jabr: in like the netherlands a teacher is like a doctor
[4/29/17, 10:49:03 AM] brandon.jabr: and paid like one more importantly
[4/29/17, 10:49:19 AM] brandon.jabr: and thats it, just from that theres no chance America's education could compete
[4/29/17, 10:49:33 AM] Matt B.: forreal
[4/29/17, 10:49:50 AM] Matt B.: thats why i be learning shit on my own time
[4/29/17, 10:50:13 AM] Matt B.: the way i see it is everyone thats in your graduate class with the same degree
[4/29/17, 10:50:19 AM] Matt B.: come out with the same education/knowledge
[4/29/17, 10:50:26 AM] Matt B.: same classes and shit
[4/29/17, 10:50:55 AM] Matt B.: thats why i feel the schools education system all fucked
[4/29/17, 10:51:04 AM] Matt B.: like u got 1k new CS grads
[4/29/17, 10:51:20 AM] Matt B.: all applying to lets say google, like google aint gonna look at that school proj bs
[4/29/17, 10:51:37 AM] Matt B.: man its all about what u do outside of school
[4/29/17, 10:51:55 AM] Matt B.: show them u really passionate about it, and dont need a teacher to tell u to open a book or learn this
[4/29/17, 10:52:18 AM] Matt B.: idk i see it like that
[4/29/17, 10:52:35 AM] Matt B.: well for me, the school aint teachin me web dev stuff so im doin it on my own
[4/29/17, 10:53:48 AM] brandon.jabr: yea i actually 100 percent feel that
[4/29/17, 10:54:30 AM] brandon.jabr: it is total bullshit in that all that should matter is if the person is really good at what they do because they love it
[4/29/17, 10:54:46 AM] brandon.jabr: and the whole idea of degrees is stupid
[4/29/17, 10:55:41 AM] Matt B.: forreal
[4/29/17, 10:55:59 AM] Matt B.: like when some1 tells me they have a degree, thats cool
[4/29/17, 10:56:09 AM] Matt B.: but u prob just sat in a class for 4 years just trynna get an A
[4/29/17, 10:56:15 AM] Matt B.: when u werent even trying to learn it
[4/29/17, 10:57:18 AM] brandon.jabr: yea i cant even stand those people
[4/29/17, 10:57:42 AM] brandon.jabr: i hate when people who dont even like computers ask me if they should do CS
[4/29/17, 10:57:53 AM] Matt B.: hahah the worst
[4/29/17, 10:58:04 AM] brandon.jabr: like one thing me and you will reap huge benefit from and we dont know it yet
[4/29/17, 10:58:28 AM] brandon.jabr: is that me and you were computer geeks from like day 1
[4/29/17, 10:59:18 AM] brandon.jabr: we literally were raised loving computers and now were tryna make careers in cs
[4/29/17, 10:59:26 AM] brandon.jabr: and id put a million dollars on
[4/29/17, 11:00:08 AM] brandon.jabr: that all those people just doin cs for the money or just cause they cant figure themselves out
[4/29/17, 11:00:35 AM] brandon.jabr: they gonna burn out so fuckin fast when they realize that being in this field means your down to sit at a pc for like 8-10 hours a day
[4/29/17, 11:01:07 AM] brandon.jabr: like homie i straight done that since i was a baby ass boy
[4/29/17, 11:01:16 AM] Matt B.: hahahah

[4/29/17, 11:54:20 AM] Matt B.: what u mean
[4/29/17, 11:54:21 AM] Matt B.: ?
[4/29/17, 11:54:33 AM] brandon.jabr: its cause btc's security is 100% based on this invariant in how trading works
[4/29/17, 11:54:55 AM] brandon.jabr: which is that each transaction, the amount taken from 1 wallet + the amount added to the other wallet
[4/29/17, 11:55:07 AM] brandon.jabr: must add to 0
[4/29/17, 11:55:14 AM] brandon.jabr: or else its flagged
[4/29/17, 11:55:18 AM] brandon.jabr: so blockchain tookl advantage
[4/29/17, 11:55:18 AM] Matt B.: o i see
[4/29/17, 11:55:24 AM] brandon.jabr: and just subtracts sent from received
[4/29/17, 11:55:28 AM] brandon.jabr: for each persons wallet
[4/29/17, 11:55:37 AM] brandon.jabr: cause its all in the btc ledger
[4/29/17, 11:55:39 AM] brandon.jabr: thats p smart

[7/6/17, 11:25:46 AM] brandon.jabr: haha fasho
v
[7/6/17, 11:25:55 AM] brandon.jabr: some code thing?
[7/6/17, 11:26:39 AM] Matt B.: yeeet
[7/6/17, 11:56:32 AM] Matt B.: lol yo
[7/6/17, 11:56:38 AM] Matt B.: maybe u can help cuz i cant find shit on google bout it
[7/6/17, 11:57:17 AM] Matt B.: i got a boolean dict like this: { 's1': True, 's2': False, 's3': False }
[7/6/17, 11:57:29 AM] Matt B.: and im looping thru like for key, value in dict
[7/6/17, 11:58:04 AM] Matt B.: and trying to see if the value is true but i believe its only seeing if the value actually exists rather then checking if its true
[7/6/17, 11:58:23 AM] Matt B.: rn im doing if value is True:
[7/6/17, 11:58:56 AM] Matt B.: it doesnt even touch the loop
[7/6/17, 11:59:11 AM] Matt B.: if i do 'if value:' it loops thru the entire dict which is wrong
[7/6/17, 11:59:15 AM] Matt B.: smh drivin me nuts
[7/6/17, 12:05:42 PM] brandon.jabr: ya so like
[7/6/17, 12:05:51 PM] brandon.jabr: if the dict is called boolDict
[7/6/17, 12:05:53 PM] brandon.jabr: is should be
[7/6/17, 12:06:02 PM] brandon.jabr: if boolDict['s1'
[7/6/17, 12:06:04 PM] brandon.jabr: woops
[7/6/17, 12:06:26 PM] brandon.jabr: if boolDict['s1'] == True
[7/6/17, 12:06:59 PM] brandon.jabr: so if ur itering
[7/6/17, 12:07:45 PM] brandon.jabr: itd be like
[7/6/17, 12:07:56 PM] brandon.jabr: for k, v in boolDict.items():
[7/6/17, 12:08:20 PM] brandon.jabr: if v == True
[7/6/17, 12:09:33 PM] brandon.jabr: maybe u didnt have the .items()?
[7/6/17, 12:18:30 PM] Matt B.: naw i had .items()
[7/6/17, 12:18:36 PM] Matt B.: its gotta be ==
[7/6/17, 12:18:37 PM] Matt B.: ?
[7/6/17, 12:18:59 PM] brandon.jabr: oh ya
[7/6/17, 12:19:03 PM] brandon.jabr: or else ur setting the val
[7/6/17, 12:19:20 PM] brandon.jabr: ohb
[7/6/17, 12:19:23 PM] brandon.jabr: ur doing
[7/6/17, 12:19:25 PM] brandon.jabr: if v is
[7/6/17, 12:19:27 PM] brandon.jabr: True
[7/6/17, 12:19:28 PM] brandon.jabr: thats fine
[7/6/17, 12:19:29 PM] Matt B.: yeah
[7/6/17, 12:19:32 PM] brandon.jabr: send me ur loop
[7/6/17, 12:19:40 PM] Matt B.: kk sec
[7/6/17, 12:22:01 PM] Matt B.: https://codeshare.io/5XNNBn
[7/6/17, 12:22:06 PM] Matt B.: this easier
[7/6/17, 12:22:27 PM] Matt B.: i tried value == True still didnt work
[7/6/17, 12:22:45 PM] Matt B.: i even converted the true/false to a damn int with 1 and 0 and didnt like that either lol
[7/6/17, 12:22:46 PM] brandon.jabr: what does printing addon_cd spit out
[7/6/17, 12:22:56 PM] Matt B.: sec
[7/6/17, 12:23:03 PM] Matt B.: its the dictionary like
[7/6/17, 12:23:07 PM] Matt B.: {'s1': True, 's2': False, etc}
[7/6/17, 12:23:24 PM] brandon.jabr: and
[7/6/17, 12:23:30 PM] brandon.jabr: ProductAddOn si another dict?
[7/6/17, 12:23:39 PM] Matt B.: yeah thats the SQL query
[7/6/17, 12:23:49 PM] Matt B.: and that is just the dict as well
[7/6/17, 12:23:54 PM] brandon.jabr: ok
[7/6/17, 12:23:55 PM] Matt B.: like if i die if value:
[7/6/17, 12:24:05 PM] Matt B.: it does all items in the loop
[7/6/17, 12:24:08 PM] Matt B.: do**
[7/6/17, 12:24:22 PM] Matt B.: i trired if value: and if value is True and if value == 1
[7/6/17, 12:24:36 PM] Matt B.: lol its wack not workin idk why
[7/6/17, 12:25:44 PM] Matt B.: posted teh dict for the boolean dict
[7/6/17, 12:26:52 PM] Matt B.: ive tried literally every solution i could think of or find lol
[7/6/17, 12:27:12 PM] Matt B.: just not making those damn invoice items for the addons
[7/6/17, 12:28:36 PM] brandon.jabr: ya like thats correct
[7/6/17, 12:28:37 PM] brandon.jabr: not if value
[7/6/17, 12:28:52 PM] brandon.jabr: well actually if they only true or false thats fine
[7/6/17, 12:28:53 PM] brandon.jabr: but
[7/6/17, 12:28:55 PM] brandon.jabr: i did it myself
[7/6/17, 12:28:57 PM] brandon.jabr: and it worked
[7/6/17, 12:29:04 PM] brandon.jabr: maybe print ur dict
[7/6/17, 12:29:05 PM] Matt B.: huh
[7/6/17, 12:30:05 PM] Matt B.: its like it snot even registering the value as a boolean
[7/6/17, 12:30:13 PM] Matt B.: cuz i printed out the key and value and it works
[7/6/17, 12:30:23 PM] brandon.jabr: send me like
[7/6/17, 12:30:23 PM] Matt B.: just that conditional statement fuckin up
[7/6/17, 12:30:34 PM] brandon.jabr: the script haha
[7/6/17, 12:30:40 PM] Matt B.: haha its lowkey big
[7/6/17, 12:30:54 PM] brandon.jabr: haha fasho

[7/6/17, 12:33:38 PM] brandon.jabr: ill scope it
[7/6/17, 12:33:47 PM] Matt B.: look at codeshare
[7/6/17, 12:33:58 PM] Matt B.: printed key and value
[7/6/17, 12:34:04 PM] Matt B.: but never got to the warning message
[7/6/17, 12:34:08 PM] Matt B.: messages.warning(request=request, message=item)
[7/6/17, 12:34:19 PM] Matt B.: and the key and values are correcy
[7/6/17, 12:34:27 PM] brandon.jabr: hmm
[7/6/17, 12:34:28 PM] brandon.jabr: u cant
[7/6/17, 12:34:32 PM] brandon.jabr: just copy paste like

[7/6/17, 12:38:35 PM] brandon.jabr: yee
[7/6/17, 12:39:01 PM] Matt B.: i think it might be the dict values are strings and not booleans
[7/6/17, 12:39:05 PM] Matt B.: thats 1 thing i didnt true
[7/6/17, 12:39:06 PM] Matt B.: try
[7/6/17, 12:39:18 PM] brandon.jabr: u send it?
[7/6/17, 12:39:19 PM] Matt B.: but the fields are booleans
[7/6/17, 12:39:22 PM] Matt B.: doin it rn

[7/6/17, 12:41:01 PM] Matt B.: oh oh
[7/6/17, 12:41:12 PM] Matt B.: lmaoo thought u found the issue
[7/6/17, 12:41:21 PM] brandon.jabr: oh hahaha
[7/6/17, 12:41:41 PM] Matt B.: django p easy to read im sure
[7/6/17, 12:42:07 PM] Matt B.: its the deploy_detail function
[7/6/17, 12:42:15 PM] brandon.jabr: yee i see it
[7/6/17, 12:42:17 PM] brandon.jabr: aight so
[7/6/17, 12:42:30 PM] brandon.jabr: addon_cd is only formed if the if statement its in runs
[7/6/17, 12:42:36 PM] brandon.jabr: so maybe addon_cd is nil
[7/6/17, 12:42:47 PM] Matt B.: naw the addon_cd is the django generated dict
[7/6/17, 12:42:51 PM] Matt B.: the {}
[7/6/17, 12:42:57 PM] Matt B.: {'s1}
[7/6/17, 12:43:03 PM] brandon.jabr: oh ok
[7/6/17, 12:43:08 PM] Matt B.: ya that 1 lol
[7/6/17, 12:43:34 PM] Matt B.: smh
[7/6/17, 12:43:38 PM] Matt B.: it was a string
[7/6/17, 12:43:42 PM] Matt B.: if value is 'True':
[7/6/17, 12:43:42 PM] brandon.jabr: haha
[7/6/17, 12:43:43 PM] Matt B.: works
[7/6/17, 12:43:44 PM] brandon.jabr: shiett
[7/6/17, 12:43:50 PM] brandon.jabr: thats some shit
[7/6/17, 12:43:53 PM] Matt B.: wow thats wack
[7/6/17, 12:44:01 PM] Matt B.: can keys be booleans
[7/6/17, 12:44:08 PM] Matt B.: they must imo
[7/6/17, 12:44:12 PM] brandon.jabr: keys?
[7/6/17, 12:44:12 PM] Matt B.: i mean values
[7/6/17, 12:44:15 PM] brandon.jabr: ya
[7/6/17, 12:44:17 PM] brandon.jabr: values forsure
[7/6/17, 12:44:22 PM] Matt B.: yeah yeah no doubt
[7/6/17, 12:44:26 PM] brandon.jabr: maybe cause django has to account for non python
[7/6/17, 12:44:27 PM] Matt B.: django prob fucked that shit up
[7/6/17, 12:44:31 PM] Matt B.: yeah def
[7/6/17, 12:44:33 PM] brandon.jabr: and not all accept True
[7/6/17, 12:44:36 PM] brandon.jabr: as  a raw bool
[7/6/17, 12:44:44 PM] Matt B.: shieet thats whack af
[7/6/17, 12:44:49 PM] brandon.jabr: idk tho haha thats shit ass
[7/6/17, 12:44:55 PM] Matt B.: lmaoo
[7/6/17, 12:44:58 PM] Matt B.: i see now
[7/6/17, 12:45:05 PM] Matt B.: a lot of django functions use a to_python() method
[7/6/17, 12:45:10 PM] Matt B.: but this form field doesnt
[7/6/17, 12:45:12 PM] Matt B.: thats odd
[7/6/17, 12:45:15 PM] brandon.jabr: huh
[7/6/17, 12:45:25 PM] Matt B.: wow thats WHACK
[7/6/17, 12:45:31 PM] brandon.jabr: django just got some gay points on my list
[7/6/17, 12:45:33 PM] Matt B.: spent the entire morning on that bs
[7/6/17, 12:45:39 PM] Matt B.: looool
[7/6/17, 12:45:40 PM] brandon.jabr: thats some dumb asss shit
[7/6/17, 12:45:42 PM] brandon.jabr: u dont put
[7/6/17, 12:45:46 PM] Matt B.: forreal thats soft
[7/6/17, 12:45:47 PM] brandon.jabr: True and False in quotes
[7/6/17, 12:45:50 PM] brandon.jabr: the fuck
[7/6/17, 12:45:54 PM] Matt B.: might be a bug tbh
[7/6/17, 12:46:07 PM] Matt B.: prob not
[7/6/17, 12:46:39 PM] Matt B.: lmao
[7/6/17, 12:47:01 PM] Matt B.: i am seeing in django source code
[7/6/17, 12:47:07 PM] Matt B.: there is a function that is
[7/6/17, 12:47:17 PM] Matt B.: literally translates true and false strigns to boolean types lmaoo
[7/6/17, 12:48:22 PM] Matt B.: honestly is prob cuz the way i coded the forms it might have messed it up
[7/6/17, 12:49:03 PM] brandon.jabr: haha maybe but still like
[7/6/17, 12:49:08 PM] brandon.jabr: this whole python for web
[7/6/17, 12:49:18 PM] brandon.jabr: idk makin less sense to me compared to some
[7/6/17, 12:49:40 PM] Matt B.: i feel ya
[7/6/17, 12:49:44 PM] Matt B.: django makes it way too easy
[7/6/17, 12:49:47 PM] brandon.jabr: idk tho
[7/6/17, 12:49:50 PM] brandon.jabr: too many to try
[7/6/17, 12:50:01 PM] brandon.jabr: actually today i did hella of my ruby hw
[7/6/17, 12:50:03 PM] brandon.jabr: first real hw
[7/6/17, 12:50:08 PM] brandon.jabr: and ruby is some interesting shit
[7/6/17, 12:50:14 PM] Matt B.: how so
[7/6/17, 12:50:15 PM] brandon.jabr: its totally geared for web dev
[7/6/17, 12:50:18 PM] brandon.jabr: and
[7/6/17, 12:50:32 PM] brandon.jabr: its an odd syntax but it has some amazing features like
[7/6/17, 12:50:40 PM] brandon.jabr: look at how you write tests
[7/6/17, 12:50:45 PM] brandon.jabr: sec
[7/6/17, 12:51:32 PM] brandon.jabr: Scenario: User sees the welcome message
When I go to the homepage
Then I should see the welcome message
[7/6/17, 12:51:45 PM] brandon.jabr: it can parse things like this
[7/6/17, 12:51:56 PM] brandon.jabr: so that it just tests by interacting with ur web app
[7/6/17, 12:52:11 PM] brandon.jabr: actually pretty amazed by that
[7/6/17, 12:52:22 PM] brandon.jabr: you have to do some actual ruby coding
[7/6/17, 12:52:23 PM] Matt B.: haha damn thats p boss
[7/6/17, 12:52:25 PM] brandon.jabr: to get that to work
[7/6/17, 12:52:27 PM] brandon.jabr: hah yea
[7/6/17, 12:52:29 PM] brandon.jabr: sand like
[7/6/17, 12:52:38 PM] brandon.jabr: literally everything in ruby is a block
[7/6/17, 12:52:57 PM] brandon.jabr: and any arbitrary chunk of code
[7/6/17, 12:53:06 PM] brandon.jabr: can be treated like a function and called independently
[7/6/17, 12:53:28 PM] brandon.jabr: just a lot of little things
[7/6/17, 12:53:39 PM] brandon.jabr: but for web dev its actually pretty next level
[7/6/17, 12:53:47 PM] Matt B.: huh i'll check it out
[7/6/17, 12:53:51 PM] brandon.jabr: ruby gems are much much better than pip
[7/6/17, 12:53:52 PM] brandon.jabr: packages
[7/6/17, 12:53:53 PM] brandon.jabr: yee
[7/6/17, 12:54:12 PM] Matt B.: u right tho there are too many damn shits out there
[7/6/17, 12:54:20 PM] brandon.jabr: forreal
[7/6/17, 12:54:25 PM] Matt B.: just gotta pick the good ones and just stick to it
[7/6/17, 12:54:33 PM] brandon.jabr: actually tho omg
[7/6/17, 12:54:37 PM] brandon.jabr: one of python ruby or js
[7/6/17, 12:54:40 PM] brandon.jabr: should win web
[7/6/17, 12:54:43 PM] Matt B.: forreal
[7/6/17, 12:54:48 PM] Matt B.: js is winner tho
[7/6/17, 12:55:02 PM] Matt B.: but i gotta say django is quite amazing, i enjoy using it
[7/6/17, 12:55:08 PM] brandon.jabr: ya so says my friend whos dpom a web dev intern at Intel
[7/6/17, 12:55:19 PM] brandon.jabr: says the real players use JS and nothing else
[7/6/17, 12:55:25 PM] Matt B.: haha forreal
[7/6/17, 12:55:37 PM] Matt B.: im prob gonna be sayin that once i learn those js frameworks
[7/6/17, 12:56:05 PM] Matt B.: i think i like py for web cuz i really like the python syntax
[7/6/17, 12:56:08 PM] brandon.jabr: haha yea
[7/6/17, 12:56:15 PM] brandon.jabr: yea i mean
[7/6/17, 12:56:21 PM] brandon.jabr: python has so much else
[7/6/17, 12:56:25 PM] brandon.jabr: it just wasnt made for web
[7/6/17, 12:56:29 PM] brandon.jabr: specifically
[7/6/17, 12:56:53 PM] Matt B.: yeah forreal
[7/6/17, 12:56:54 PM] Matt B.: i feels
