Dad: Hi there, busy? 
me: hey i think ill be roadtripping with jake by then thats like right in the middle of my break
Dad: Where u guys goin?
me: most likely LA or Santa Barbara to meet some of the other guys, also got some really good news, I got accepted to work with the Machine Learning group at Berkeley as part of a 6 man team, which as of now i know very little about but I think about 2000 CS students applied, this is a huge opportunity
me: im meeting with my team this friday so I'll know more then but im really excited about it, this will connect me with some of the best in the field
Dad: Oh great!! Congrats yes this should be very good fr u.  You have test this week??
me: yes 2 on wednesday actually but honestly, the stats courses are cake compared to CS haha. though i like them a lot
Dad: Ok keep focused 🕵😎
Dad: Text me the class numbers
Dad: I mean the class names so I can see what's in them
me: lookup STAT 133 concepts in computing with data
me: hey i just got a $450 tax refund from the IRS, is that from the form you sent??

Dad: Ok
me: on train in 10 mins
Dad: Ok see u soon
me: on bart
me: you’re right, it’s not a feasible 1 day thing haha, it would be over 2-3 days
Dad: So you guys want to ski anyway?
me: yea we still want to do the ski and surf, but clearly it’s much more feasible in the LA area and if we stay a night with our friends there before coming back, so we can make a little trip out of that over a couple days
Dad: Also there's a night ski area east of LA ... Bear valley or something...open till 9 pm, you can google . But traffic in LA is horrible as u know 
Dad: Oh ok😎

Dad: Ok. Keep in touch. 
Dad: I'm watching Chris Cox chief product officer at Facebook talking about their launch of "Facebook Live" . I see now that Mento didn't quite make it cause it didn't convey the full experience of a moment. They're now talking about 3D being the next app that would transmit the full immersive experience
me: haha thats interesting i havent heard of that
me: boy the anthony situation sounds really bad
me: hope he didnt get paralysis
Dad: I have to say you were on the right track , you needed to "work" the idea a lot more...
Dad: Ya it could really be bad, I hope it's not!

Dad: What's ur project about?
me: alright well ull have me and mom soon haha
me: so its about creating 3d projections that use a bunch of points to very accurately model a persons body structure, the machine learning aspect tho is that this new algorithm makes it very easy to show what, for example, clothes would look like on your exact body type instead of just generic
me: pretty awesome stuff
Dad: I remember now you told me in the car. I went and climbed Garrapata yesterday...2000 feet up, 5 miles. My foot did ok, it's a test for Swiss Alps😬

Dad: Got no email!?

Dad: Hey, did u get your Mac?

me: hey yea thats perfect actuall
me: ill text u around 5ish then
me: hey just working on assignment ill be ready whenever ur coming, but take your time haha, still coming straight to the frat?
Dad: Hi, ya I'm with Ayman, were at Cesar on Ashby, will come by rnd 7:30
me: ok sounds good
Dad: Closer to 8 😁
me: haha no problem at all
me: dont want traffic anyways
Dad: Hi I'm drivin , 10 min
me: ok
Dad: Here
me: So in the past 2 weeks I've been contacted by 4 companies offering to interview me without applying, and every single one of them said it was because of the ML research, I knew this would happen haha actually one was an actual engineer from SoundHound who said my resume was "too standout to pass up" contacting me 😏😏
Dad: I have no doubt you will be hired... And "exploited"😄
me: hahaha
me: I keep thinking more about what exactly I want to do and what would be most fulfilling, and its still ML forsure but recently I've realized that the most fun I've ever had coding has to be hackiiing haha, I love the idea of doing hacking for something thats very high level tech wise but also for a much bigger purpose than just slaving for some big corp, first thing I imagine is hacking ISIS! haha Stopping terrorist attacks with ML or similar, with a private company contracted by gov, now that would be pretty incredible
Dad: Ya I think you're good at that... Game👽
me: haha yea I'm a daydreamer no doubt but sometimes the outcome is really great for me, feel very energized by that.
Dad: http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/30/zerodium-triples-ios-10-bug-bounty-to-1-5-million/
Dad: Hey Mr B😎 how are things? 
me: heyo things are fine but as i told mom it is getting stressful keeping up with work while now starting to prep for interviews since ill apply by end of next week
me: so always occupied which is good but its difficult stuff this algorithms course, the electronics has been fun tho, im doing actual circuity problems like the ones you showed me last summer, things like finding unknown voltages in a circuit etc
Dad: Good , don't overdo the prep, just make sure you know the stuff you claimed on your resume😁
me: haha yea well they care so much about these arbitrary algorithm questions its annoying, but its what ive learned now and they cant be as hard as berkeleys haha so i think ill be fine
Dad: Yes , we never used to ask interviewees specific tech stuff🤓once I remember we tried and one guy got pissed and refused to take a test😆. But times have changed... I still find it strange, I could always ask very difficult questions and fail anyone!
Dad: Hey yo how's it going? Haven't talked in a while
me: things are fine but im stressed, barely enough time for everythin
Dad: We'll prioritize: 1. Classes, 2. Job etc can wait
me: yea, i cant really apply until i have time to study for interviews etc and i dont right now so it has to wait
Dad: Which class takin the most time?
me: both algo and circuits take a lot of time problem sets are very long
me: and just material heavy
Dad: Ok take a break🍺
Dad: Wr at movie
me: haha ok talk soon
Dad: So are you coming here this weekend? Or what's the plan?
me: ok so no im not planning on coming anymore, I was gonna go down to visit iverson at cal poly for his birthday but now hes pledging a frat haha so he cant have us
me: i have to turn in an assignment tonight that im reviewing with evan, so i can talk more about it tomorrow afternoon
Dad: Ok
Dad: Call when u can talk
Dad: 
Dad: 
Dad: Brandon and Lance, you're using huge share of the fam. data . Check your apps to see where the big usage is. 
Dad: How are things? Good Spirits ? 👻
me: haha yea feel on track now for midterms, also have vegas trip to look forward to which ive been wanting to do for years
me: oh also i think the data thing might be cause of the new iphone and mac software ios10 and macOS sierra, there both buggy still and some peoples icloud documents would sync over the cell network which it shouldnt, anyways haha i disabled cell anyways now since i have my own wifi
Dad: Ya mom mentioned the Vegas trip. 👯Take lot of 💰💰and brush up on card probabilities😎
Dad: As for data, don't make sense, I have iPhone 7, I use .5 GB Lance used 8.5GB !
me: apps that we use for photo sharing, snapchat instagram etc use a TON if your not on wifi
Dad: I guess 🙄. Have a good weekend. 
me: haha its truee ok talk soon
Dad: Wow nice work👻👾👾
Dad: Hey, want anything from here like clothes etc?
me: hey no i told mom just oatmeal but i think thats it
Dad: Like I see a black winter jacket, 
Dad: Hey , Anthony Z called , Gabe left Envoy and he's now looking at selling the co. Did he contact u?
me: yes i knew about gabe leaving and i am actually talking with anthony now about being paid for the work i originally did for them way back
Dad: What's your deal w them? You wanted cash??
me: the official deal, which was made between me and chad back when they had absolutely nothing, seed round, was a covertible note at $1500 equivalent for their valuation after first round.
Dad: Hey , how are things? Had you bought any bitcoin?? It's been soaring this year

Dad: Ok
Dad: Hi, can talk?
Dad: Hello?? 
me: heyo let me call u in 15
Dad: 
 Ok
Dad: How did it go? 
me: really great, i explained my whole situation including how i felt overloaded last semester, and she said my plan is completely viable and seniors do it all the time, shes heard the same story a million times. She says that my two courses this semester, machine learning + databases, will be much more intense than what i took last semester algs + circuits. I also explained that I always end up not being able to enjoy my breadth classes when I have CS classes that take up all my time, and she thinks my plan to enroll elsewhere just for my last two breadths makes perfect sense, and I would have much more flexibility than at Berkeley
Dad: So where would you go?
me: I also asked about the pace and quality of Summer courses, which she says are equally thorough but they account for the shorter length of time by assigning less busywork
me: Right so now I'm goin to look at my options for the breadth courses and lets have another call say tomorrow. I already feel much more confident about it but I'll discuss with you when Ive found out more
Dad: I want some more info now can u call
Dad: Hi, how did it go today?
me: hey was about to text you, it went great, so ive narrowed it to two viable options, let me call you now
me: 1 min
me: hey just emailed you list of all the courses ive done by subject, I'll text u tomorrow when I finalize foothill possible courses
Dad: Ok Thanks
me: just sent u an email with two photos attached that show the classes at foothill i can take for both breadths, let me know any that you think would be good, I’d be interested in several of them
Dad: In bio, I would say cell biology is a good foundation. Human genetics is good but do u have enough background? Nutrition is interesting
Dad: In genetics you could apply your cs know how to see how they do gene decoding
Dad: I seem to remember you did some in HSchool
Dad: Human anatomy good for sorts and general knowledge but has 3 parts
me: i def have enough background for genetics, I’d choose either that or nutrition, both would be interesting
Dad: Comp Religions West as u seem interested in religion. The eastern religions are interesting too👳🏾‍♀️, International relations important for understanding our times of globalization ...
me: ok good haha i also was most interested in either of those
me: i think id choose western, for sake of curiousity about christianity and islam
Dad: You should also try some Real Human Relations 👹
Dad: By the way you listed database and machine learning as "done"?
me: no i just meant i will be doing those
Dad: So as far as Berkeley you'd not be enrolled at all?? 
Dad: Didn't you say once you weren't allowed semester off
me: yes you withdraw then on coming back you show classes u took and the grades you got. If you get B’s overall then no problem, which obviously is no problem for 2-3 foothill online classes, I said you can’t in the sense that you can’t just leave and do nothing or do poorly somewhere else and come back. It’s fine as long as its up to the standard.
Dad: K , make sure you don't lose your cs standing!!!
me: no haha.. I even met with the CS advisor remember
Dad: Ok. 
Dad: How do they allow you to stay in frat if you are not enrolled in classes ?
me: that doesn’t matter to them, if we pay i can stay. also nobody would ever do anything about it lol its just us kids here
me: ok good, so ill do western religions and decide between genetics and nutrition and sign up tomorrow, then i set up advisor appt tomorrow to do the withdrawal and everything should be finalized. I’ll text you in evening when im done and also any info about getting refunded for the classes, tho I think it’s just automatic.
Dad: Maybe u should intern with them while doing foothill 😊
Dad: Also think about a internship or R&d in Berkeley !! 
Dad: There's lots companies there
Dad: Good
Dad: Can you email me your resume
Dad: How did it go today?
me: great so ive signed up for nutrition and western religions now, and begun the withdrawal process with my advisor which should be finalized by tomorrow
Dad: Do they give you guarantee that you're in CS major

me: withdrawal has nothing to do with the major
Dad: Call me cause it's too long winded to write
me: what?
me: oh call u, i cant right now
Dad: Later?

me: umm i can after 11 yea
Dad: Ok
Dad: By the way please explain what's keeping you busy? Just as courtesy
me: i joined the courses 1 day late, so im just doing the intro assignments for both before theyre due
Dad: Thanks
Dad: I talked to Alex Kurzhanski who is a research postdoctoral at Berkeley, remember I talked about him. Turns out he has good contacts at Uber and PayPal. I was looking more for Berkeley area jobs. Anyway meeting him Wed for dinner. Can I forward him your resume?
me: yea of course haha thanks those are great connects
me: is that what u wanted to say?
Dad: No I wanted to make sure there's no misunderstanding about your ability to go back to the program
me: my cs advisor saw and approved it
Dad: And we trust her??😬
Dad: I.e. Get it in email or something
Dad: Ok. Hope to see u wed before dinner w Alex
me: but really i dont think your major is a part of this at all, just that you dont waste time while away
me: ok sounds gooood
Dad: Hey can we meet tomorrow between 4-5 pm, I'm havi dinner w Alex at 6
me: ok i think thats fine but let me see i didnt plan some interview then
me: ok i can do that
Dad: Ok will drive to TKE, will text u when there, round 4pm.  Need anything from here?
me: ok ill let u know if i do
Dad: Also may want to meet Alex, maybe go to his office, I'll ask when is good
me: haha ok
Dad: Want to join for dinner?
Dad: Might be fun
me: its better if i met u again when u went to his office for me
me: but i would do that sure
Dad: His office is in Richmond off campus
Dad: Ya come along were very informal
me: ok well talk tom
me: heyo i did think of a few things you could bring me actually, my headphone stuff haha its just 3 things all will be on my desk or in the top right droor of the desk, ill send u pics cause its easier
Dad: Ok 
me: ￼￼￼
me: thanks, theres the pics if u dont see any let me know. Theres a shoebox on the bottom of the bookshelf left of my desk they can be thrown into, it has some audio cables in it
Dad: Can u talk
Dad: 
Do u want the audio cables in the shoebox?
me: yes please, everything in the shoebox would be perfect
me: let me know when you start headin up
Dad: At 92
me: ok
Dad: Entering Bkly
Dad: Here
me: comin
Dad: Hi, Alex forwarded your resume to a co called Iteris. They do many disparate types of software. One division called Clear Ag works on agricultural contracts, they are trying to automate contracts using block chain tech😎and that's where it becomes interesting
me: haha ok great thank you, ill let you know if anyone messages me
Dad: Yea🤛
Dad: Hi, how are things? What's new?
Dad: ￼Remember Homewood? Went there Friday, great snow
me: haha yea! wow looks great
me: looks empty too
Dad: Fri yes but sat very busy
Dad: So you re done with withdrawal etc
me: yes all done
Dad: How was palantir?
me: oh the first phone screen went great but i told you guys i thought, next one is in a weekish
Dad: Ok. Are you still going to see counselor about Wellbutrin 
me: yes i have an appt mid february i think the 14tj
Dad: Ok good. All else goin well?
me: yea my foothill professors have only given me 100s so far lol so those classes shouldnt be a problem, otherwise yea nothing new
Dad: What u reading in religion??👳🏼
me: haha hinduism right mow
Dad: I thought u taking western??
me: first the tribal religions and now hinduism, pretty interesting actually, lot of very agreeable beliefs
me: yea but we survey more than just western
me: to understand how the more ancient religions paved way for the modern western ones
me: its just a chapter on hinduism
Dad: Sounds good. Following some database or other like we talked
Dad: No answer??
me: ?
me: oh i didnt think u were asking a question haha, im doing a small machine learning project rn thats a little library for making it easy to add computer vision to ur app
Dad: I saw that in your resume but forgot to alsk u
me: yea something ive been needing to finish
me: the interviewers always bring up my machine learning stuff every time
Dad: But is that exclusive of auditing a cs class to make it easier in summer
me: no, one of my friends is in databases and i can do the projects with him 
Dad: Ok 👍👍
Dad: Happy Year of the 🐔 Rooster 🐔 🐔🐔🐔🐔
me: haha yea the chinese guys in the house were celebrating
Dad: Hey remember that laser pointer u had? It was in the garage
me: haha really I haven’t seen that in forever
me: about to start interview for startup
Dad: Ok later 
me: kk
me: so that startup is called Index, theyre founded by some ex-googlers who were doing Google Wallet, and they split to do a modernized payment system at checkout lines where you have to stick the chip on your credit card in. They apparently have a system that takes 2 seconds instead of current systems which takes forever, and theyre partnered with Visa and Mastercard so I thought it would be a cool one to apply to
Dad: Ya sounds interesting. They probably want people fast
me: yea they didnt really mention a rushed timeline yet, they just said they maintain 6 new grad hires a year and it works for them
Dad: Hey, just spoke to Brian Lillie , he's now high up at Equinix, has 1000 people reporting. Asked about you, said you should meet his team of CS.
Dad: Hey yo where are you
me: hey still sick actually so im kind of bed ridden
Dad: Hmm need some Ned's?
Dad: Mess
Dad: Meds
me: no my roommate actually has a poy
me: lot
Dad: Fever? 
Dad: Can u FT?
me: no i cant, no i dont have a fever just stuffy and tired
Dad: Hey, how are things? Feel I haven't talked to you in a while. 
me: heyo everything going great actually, yea was actually thinking the same thing I’ve been keeping myself busy, when I come home for moms bday we should do some hiking/biking, im missing rancho haha. Were on Christianity now in our religions class, ive learned a ton actually im enjoying it a lot, and so far its by far the most interesting. The story of Jesus is really grabbing, he was a much more charismatic presence than I had thought, at least thats how our book describes him
Dad: Yes he had to be to have upset the Roman and Hebrew world order. Maybe the first or most effective popular revolutionary...
me: yea thats exactly how I described him in an essay, a revolutionary haha. He spoke very intensely for the time I think, it both scared and energized people
me: like those sayings “easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom”, i remember you telling me that one, they emphasized that one as really angering the roman order
Dad: Yea, I guess no chance for me 😬...
Some think Paul was the one who formulated the Christian philosophy and spread  it. The Roman Empire later highjacked it in their favor to form the Holy Roman Empire
me: hahaha yea makes you feel guilty in a way but i guess thats why it stuck, yea i was surprised to find how little Jesus actually tried to make a new religion so to speak, seems like everything in terms of the religion itself came after his death or the “good news” of his resurrection, explained why theres so many branches. Seems like all the good stuff can be learned just from reading about Jesus and what he said
me: im in a discussion now for machine learning ive been going for a couple weeks now just to keep up
Dad: Ok, later. You should watch "The young pope" series, it deals very smartly with all issues Catholics grapple with. 
me: ok ill look it up, later
Dad: Hi so checking back with you, can you call
me: hey sure give me 10 mins
Dad: Ok
me: heyo so looks like plan is ill come tomorrow evening, ill bart to fremont, im guessing later is better to avoid traffic
Dad: Ok
Dad: So did u sign up fr summer? What's the latest?
me: my signup slot starts next monday, no problems, been meeting w/ advisor often shes very good. not lily the college one, well talk more when im back tho
Dad: 😎👍👍
Dad: Ya sure
Dad: Brandon, did u figure out what time you're coming tomorrow?
Dad: Where are you??
me: hey does pickup at 2 from fremont work?
Dad: Yes that's fine
me: ok ill text when i get on
me: at station but next train is 15 mins
Dad: Ok 😊 
Dad: I'll pick u up at UNION CITY STATION, closer fr you. 
me: ok sounds good
me: k on train
Dad: Ok call now
me: actually it was just to say the office was closed by the time i called since i prepped up a very nice outline of all the payments etc. to make sure they dont cheat me haha, but was just gonna say ill call tomorrow morning and get back to you
Dad: Ok
me: hey Ive emailed you a timeline ive spent 3 hours making yesterday to show where the money came and went...I cant stand the Berkeley finance people anymore, they dont know anything from anything, but the chart should help so let me know.
Dad: Just saw your text. Ok thanks don't waste any more time on it. 
Dad: Ya it actually makes sense, we did get refunded for the $5610 tuition, then added some fees . Looks ok
me: ok sounds good
Dad: Don't forget to send the AI book. Also was watching a program about how much time younger gen spend on iPhone...they think it contributes a lot to anxiety level!! 
me: ya ill send it now then, well spending is one thing but its the fact that all these apps are literally designed to maximize addiction…anything that increases time on the app means more ad revenue, simple as that. I don’t use Facebook or Instagram anymore
me: actually this is a big thing im thinking all the time about, theres going to be a breaking point, my generation is being trained to not think…
Dad: Yes that's what the 60 min program was about
me: so there must be a shift towards using this amazing technology to make peoples lives better, like IBMs watson medical robot etc., no more iphone apps.
Dad: They were interviewing Tristan Harris a former google prod manager, I'll send the web link
me: yea id like to hear him, google is not clear if they really care to benefit people, some projects yes others no
me: oh yes yes i saw this
me: yea he says it very well, programming people directly
me: and why is because we have neural networks that, if given a specific context like how long you stay on snapchat or youtube after looking at this or that or when they change the UI color to this etc., they get a perfect model of your brain on that one app, now they know whatll get you hooked before you do, hmm
me: might as well be mind control
Dad: 👻👾👾
me: we are doomed i really think haha, there will have to be a revolt i mean its insane, i think sometimes this is where capitalism ultimately fails - we have all the best technology before anyone else…but thats from business here being purely driven by money aka greed, aka the opposite of helping anyone haha
Dad: You mean exploiting people... yes unfortunately the business ethic has become like that... but wasn't always the case, you could still find some co. Trying to provide an honest product or service
me: yes exactly, no i definitely think not every single big biz is like that, its just unfortunate that you cannot raise money unless your idea is profitable, theres no bank or firm you can get funded by simply because your idea makes peoples lives better, even if you proved it true hah, only the super wealthy can really do that by funding themselves. just interesting to realize haha
me: heyo can ya call anytime soon? no rush just about selling that computer at home
Dad: 5 min
me: ￼got it to boot up! 
me: was the RAM.. had to remove on by one.
Dad: Good🦊learning hardware😀
me: and what a pain it is haha
me: but i do really like tinkering
Dad: How are the festivities🍺🍺?
me: woops haha theyre just starting up tonight
me: but today was crazy haha best cal day here so far
Dad: Had fun? 
me: hahaha it was incredibly fun, everyone crashin now
me: ￼Going for 1st for last machine learning homework contest haha,
Dad: 👍👍wish you'd taken the stupid class🤖
me: well itll be nothing now
Dad: Ok hit the booster 🚀switch
me: ￼got it 👌
Dad: Awesome 🥊
Dad: How's it scored?
me: basically they give us a test set of data usually in an excel file and we submit the labels our model predicts
Dad: So it's how close to perfect labeling...
me: well, i got 74 percent but this is unsupervised learning for the first time, meaning the training data isnt labeled either so the model has to learn the patterns totally on its own. its actually a "joke recommender" - we take a set of reviews people gave a bunch of jokes and predict whether they would like some new joke. So here i recommend correctly about 3/4 times
Dad: Got it👌
Dad: Hey yo can you call?
me: im out for a while, whats up?
Dad: Just to chat before we leave Sunday. We can talk tomoro but remember to call
me: oh ok heard the voicemail
me: ok yea tomorrow then
me: i can call whenever really, just let me know
Dad: Hi . Just arrived to our hotel in fez , morocco. Long flites but all good 
Dad: HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎁 Brandon 🍾🍾🍾
Doing anything special? 

me: Thanks daddio 😁 yea well be going to the bars at midnight for a crawl, should be fun haha
me: ￼looks like mercedes benz wants some new grads for their own self driving car tech haha
Dad: They pay 💰 with Mz cars??😉
me: if so im in hahaha
Dad: MBz, Nisan, BMW , Tesla and many others are spending heavily on self driving tech. Even supliers like Continental and of course Google , Apple , Delphi etc . Look into making a classifier that classes objects by distance from a camera... you could make $$$$
Dad: ￼From horseshow at 🎉 I 
me: hes having a horseshow? haha
Dad: Woke up to some great pics 👍👍. We stayed late and wifi here spotty.
Dad:

Dad: We're in Paris. Enjoyed your graduation photos, lookin good👌👌. Did you get the video of the wedding? 
me: haha yea just saw that actually, looks so extravagent hah i guess they really like putting on a show
Dad: Coming today? I'm going biking in Fremont now with my friend Sami. What's your plan?
me: hey so im planning to come thursday/friday since theres still a lot of people here and want to say goodbye to some people graduating, ill know forsure by tomorow. that fine?
Dad: Ok
me: ￼One of my latest hacks, after 3 days of tinkering I managed go turn my desktop PC into a "Hackintosh", its when you get a custom built desktop to boot and run MacOS smoothly despite Apple not officially supporting your hardware. My PC has an Nvidia graphics card which is a must for machine learning nowadays, but stupid Apple doesnt make any macs with Nvidia, so I had to find a workaround 😎
Dad: Good work🍒
me: For my first big ML project, im going to make an AI that you interact with via your webcam, and it will answer questions about whats going on in the room. I'm selling a pair of my headphones to buy a super GPU for a couple hundred, and train on the Microsoft COCO image set. Itll take 2 weeks to train 😭 haha but then ill have a really amazing model that can describe any image in a well worded sentence, or in response to a question about that image. Then it needs some natural language processing on both ends, to understand my question and produce a Siri like voice response. Lets see how it goes 
Dad: Sounds good. NLP is tough though!
me: yea need to see if google has a model i can use haha
Dad: Figured out timing?
me: so im gonna try and get on bart on friday by 12, that too late for traffic or ok?
Dad: It's ok , maybe catch 1 pm better fr me
me: ok no prob
Dad: How about a classifier that classes cars in a photo of the road according to distance? 
me: i thought about it but i think itd be a waste compared to tech like your lidar etc, neural nets are not good at depth perception of all things regarding image recognition, it takes more than one layer for it to "get" how far things are, a laser could do it 1000x faster no?
Dad: Lidar has big problems , I've been looking into it for 6 mo and it seemed to me using a simple cam with software might be better, it's needed anyway for recognizing road signs & signals. I don't know the compute time required to do this
me: oh ok well then that does make it interesting. I had an idea from last time we talked, maybe the best is something in between. A big issue with lidar is that the high end models are big and expensive like on googles cars since theyre emitting a continous wave of lasers and spinning to map all around. Good for mapping terrain but its overkill in general, what if just one laser was attached to a wide camera lens, and the AI can say "zap" objects it sees to get an instant distance measure
Dad: 🎇exactly what I was thinking! 👌that way the lidar can be simplified , a laser assisted AI , could be patented
me: haha alright lets patent it! We could build that easily, a RasberryPi, ball socket motor and a laser 😂
Dad: We'll discuss Fri🚨
me: 👌
me: heyo so 1pm tomorrow ok?
me: as in i get on bart at 1, so 2 pickup
Dad: Ya sure
me: ok see ya then
Dad: 😘😘😘
Dad: Yep😀 looked like a ⭐️ 
Dad: Yes
me: hey you call?
me: called back but didnt go thru
Dad: What u up to? 
me: just watchin tv, goin for drinks withkevin and jake at 8 
Dad: Ok. Looks like Mufida stable but not out of danger. I'm goin to dinner with my business party
me: ok 
Dad: Turns out my appointment is 11:45 !
me: hah ok
me: hey im out at gabes house, front door locked
Dad: Ok
me: hey back home where u at?
Dad: Almost here
